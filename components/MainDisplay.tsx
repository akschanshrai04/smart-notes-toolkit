The tech stack includes React.js or Vue.js for frontend, Node.js with Express.js or Django for backend, MongoDB (NoSQL) or PostgreSQL for database, and Firebase Authentication or JWT for secure login. The platform aims to save costs for students, promote sustainability, and build a community of sharing and collaboration.")
